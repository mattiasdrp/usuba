                            copy_propagation.ml

     Copy propagation (abreviated CP throughout Usubac) is yet another
     very common optimization, which consists in eliminating unnecessary
     assignments. Typically,

        x = a + b;
        y = x;
        z = y + c;

     Becomes:

        x = a + b;
        z = x + c;

     Note that when this module runs, the only copy-assignments in the
     code are of primitive types (ie Uint(_,_,1)) since we are in
     Usuba0. (only function calls return multiple arguments, and are
     by definition not "copy-assignments")
     Assignments of Const to variables are also removed by this module
     whenever possible.

     A few things are slightly tricky:

     1\ Not eliminate copies to outputs.
     For instance:

        node f(a:b1) returns (b:b2)
        let
            x = a ^ b;
            b[0] = x;
            y = b[0] ^ 1
            b[1] = y;
        tel

     Should (obisouly) not become:

        node f(a:b1) returns (b:b2)
        let
            x = a ^ b;
            y = x ^ 1;
        tel

     But rather:

        node f(a:b1) returns (b:b2)
        let
            b[0] = a ^ b;
            b[1] = x ^ 1;
        tel


     2\ Not eliminate variables that are going to be used in loops.
     For instance, in the following code,

        x[0] = y;
        forall i in [1, 5] {
          x[i] = a + x[i-1];
        }

     `x[0] = y` should not be removed.


     3\ Not eliminate assignments to arrays that later used in function
     calls. For instance:

        x[0] = a;
        x[1] = b;
        ... = f(x);

     If the first two assignments are optimized away, things gets
     complicated in the call to |f|...


     All of those issues (1,2,3) are dealt with by computing a set
     (called |env_keep| throughout this module) of variables that must
     not be optimized away. This is an overapproximation, because in a
     case like:

       a:u2,b:u2
       b[0] = a[0];
       b[1] = a[1];
       ... = f(b)

     We will not optimized out `b` even though it could be an `f` could
     be called with `a` instead of `b`. TODO: fix.

     Furthermore, within loops, no arrays whatsoever are optimized out:

       node f(x,y:u2[2]) returns (z:u2[2])
          vars a,b,c,d,e:u2[2]
       let
           forall i in [0,1] {
             a[i] = x[i] ^ y[i];
             b[i] = a[i];
             c[i] = b[i];
             d[i] = f(c[i]);
             e[i] = d[i];
             z[i] = e[i]
           }
       tel

     Would not be optimized at all. TODO: fix.

    node f(x,y:b1) returns (z:b1)
      vars t1:b1
    let
      z = x ^ y;
    tel

   I'm pretty sure that GCC/Clang are pretty good at optimizing
   that. However, this would be better for the heuristic inlining: the
   node f above would be recognized as being 50% assignment without
   backward copy propagation, which is obviously wrong: it's actually
   0% assignments...
